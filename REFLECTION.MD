Dear reader,

Processwise I think it was on par with the first assignment. This assignment was a bit more on the logic side and their was a hint of time preassure, so perhaps I would have benefitted from a bit more calmness in my mind as it turned out I ended up with more then enough time. I think it was a great assignment and learning experience, very creative and some amazing prolem solving.

As said next time I want to take more time so I can truly problemetize my code and refactors it to be consistent.

Kind regards,
Bart Kuijper
